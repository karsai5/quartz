There's something incredilby relaxing about the slow nature of this game. I ended up playing it on my steam deck which meant I could enjoy large amounts of downtime in the world of Revachol. Take your time playing this game, even though it's a long game by the time I finished it I immediately wanted to start a second playthrough. Shout out to Kim Kitsuragi one of the best video game sidekicks, definitely deserves his own spinoff game.
